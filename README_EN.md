# Good-Badminton: AI Badminton Hawk-Eye System 🏸

## Related Projects

Good-Badminton, Good-Tennis, and Good-Pickleball are part of the same family of computer-vision sports video analysis projects. They share the same core ideas: player detection, ball trajectory tracking, court coordinate mapping, movement statistics, and visualized outputs. Each project adapts the court model, ball target, and sport-specific rules to a different sport.

## ✨ Features

- **Player pose detection** - Supports RTMPose, RTMO, and Ultralytics YOLO Pose for human keypoint and skeleton detection.
- **Shuttlecock detection** - Uses a YOLO model to detect shuttlecock positions and draw trajectories in the output video.
- **Court coordinate mapping** - Manually annotates court keypoints and maps image coordinates to standard badminton court coordinates.
- **Automatic court detection** - Matches visible white/yellow court lines against a standard badminton court model, with manual corner correction available in the WebUI.
- **Player position tracking** - Tracks upper-court and lower-court players separately and records movement trajectories.
- **Rally detection** - Detects rally start/end states from continuous court-view matching and records rally IDs in overlays and detection data.
- **Motion statistics** - Computes movement distance, current speed, maximum speed, and rally counts.
- **Visual output** - Generates annotated videos with skeletons, trajectories, statistics, and court trajectory overlays.
- **Position charts** - Automatically generates player position heatmaps and scatter plots.
- **Chinese / English display** - Switch visualization text with `--language zh/en`.
- **WebUI** - Browser-based interface built with Gradio. Upload videos, detect the court, configure parameters, and view results without touching the command line.
- **Local execution** - Videos, models, and analysis outputs stay on your local machine.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg available in system `PATH`
- Shuttlecock YOLO detection weight, downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yo-WASSUP/Good-Badminton/releases/latest)

## Performance Requirements and Reference Speed

Recommended setup:

- GPU with 6GB+ VRAM. More VRAM helps with higher-resolution videos and larger pose models.
- 16GB+ system RAM.
- SSD storage for output videos, `detections.jsonl`, and visualization images.
- CPU execution is supported, but pose detection and shuttlecock detection will be much slower. It is best suited for short clips or feature checks.

Actual speed depends on the GPU, video resolution, pose model, preview display, and audio export settings.

For a 720p video with `--pose-family yolo-pose --yolo-pose-model yolo11n-pose.pt` and `weights/yolo11s-ball.pt`, GPU timing logs are typically close to:

```text
pose 0.02s, shuttlecock 0.02s, shuttle draw 0.00s, players draw 0.01s, court draw 0.00s
```

Use `--performance-stats` to print a compact timing summary about every 5 seconds and identify whether the bottleneck is pose inference, shuttlecock detection, or drawing.

## 🚀 Installation

The default dependencies use CPU PyTorch and ONNX Runtime.

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### GPU Acceleration (Windows / NVIDIA)

Prerequisites:

- NVIDIA driver installed, and `nvidia-smi` works correctly.
- CUDA 12.1 PyTorch wheels are recommended.

PowerShell:

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

pip uninstall -y torch torchvision onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121 torchvision==0.20.1+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.20.1
```

Verify GPU availability:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print('torch:', torch.__version__); print('cuda:', torch.cuda.is_available()); print('gpu:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'not available')"
python -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print(ort.__version__); print(ort.get_available_providers())"
```

Expected output includes:

```text
cuda: True
CUDAExecutionProvider
```

> Note: after installing GPU ONNX Runtime, `pip check` may report `rtmlib requires onnxruntime, which is not installed`. If provider verification shows `CUDAExecutionProvider`, do not reinstall CPU `onnxruntime`, because it may overwrite the GPU package.

Switch back to CPU dependencies:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
```


### WebUI Installation (Optional)

The WebUI is built with Gradio and requires an additional dependency:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-webui.txt
```

Launch the WebUI:

```bash
python -m webui.app
```

Open the URL printed in the terminal (default `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) and:

1. Upload the match video. The court template image is optional: when it is omitted, the WebUI samples frames evenly across the video and selects the frame with the strongest court-detection result and suitable clarity as the template.
2. Click "Auto-select Video Frame & Detect Court". To correct, click 4 corners on the image then click "Apply Manual Corners"; uploading a manually captured template image overrides automatic frame selection.
3. Adjust analysis settings (pose model, language, visualization options, etc.).
4. Click "Run Analysis" and wait for the progress bar. Results include the annotated video, heatmaps/scatter plots, and detection data.
5. Click the `›_` button in the bottom-right corner to inspect live backend output, including model initialization, processing progress, FFmpeg export, and error traces.

| Court Detection and Settings | Analysis Results |
| --- | --- |

The WebUI is optional — the CLI workflow is unchanged.

## 📝 Usage

### First Run Workflow (CLI)

1. Prepare the input video and shuttlecock detection weight.
2. Run the basic command:

```bash
python main.py --video-path videos/demo.mp4
```

3. If `--template-path` is not provided, the program opens a file picker for a court template image. Usually, choose a stable frame with clear court lines.
4. The program first tries to detect the court boundary automatically and saves `outputs/<video_name>/auto_court_preview.png`. Press Enter/Y in the preview window to accept it, or press M/R/Esc to switch to manual four-corner annotation.
5. If manual annotation is used, follow the prompt at the top of the image and click the four court corners in order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left.

![Court annotation example](assets/label_court_example.png)

6. After the four points are selected, the window shows a green court box and a blue pose-detection ROI. The ROI is generated automatically from the court area.
7. The annotation is saved to `outputs/<video_name>/court_annotations.txt`. Re-running with the same output directory reuses this file.
8. After analysis finishes, check `outputs/<video_name>/detect_<video_name>.mp4`, `detections.jsonl`, and `position_visualizations/`.

Why four court points are required:

- The four corners establish the mapping from image coordinates to standard badminton court coordinates.
- Player filtering mainly depends on court coordinates, which helps remove spectators, referees, and people outside the court.
- Upper/lower court player assignment, movement distance, speed, rally statistics, heatmaps, and scatter plots all depend on this mapping.
- Rally detection uses court template matching: consecutive court-view frames start a rally, and consecutive non-court-view frames end it.
- The pose ROI only reduces the inference area and improves speed. It is automatically expanded from the court area.
- Shuttlecock detection still runs on the full frame, with basic filtering based on the horizontal court range plus padding.

If the video angle, crop, or template image changes, delete the corresponding `court_annotations.txt` and annotate the four points again.


### Pose Model Selection

```bash
# Default: two-stage RTMPose balanced
python main.py --video-path videos/demo.mp4 --pose-family rtmpose --pose-mode balanced

# Lighter one-stage RTMO
python main.py --video-path videos/demo.mp4 --pose-family rtmo --pose-mode lightweight

# Use Ultralytics YOLO Pose
python main.py --video-path videos/demo.mp4 --pose-family yolo-pose --yolo-pose-model yolo11n-pose.pt
```

RTMPose / RTMO modes:

- `lightweight`: prioritizes speed.
- `balanced`: default tradeoff between speed and quality.
- `performance`: larger model, slower, usually better for detection quality.
